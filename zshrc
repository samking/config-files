# There are many resources online to help you make your shell how you want it.
# http://grml.org/zsh/zsh-lovers.html has a good compilation of many resources,
# including many of the ones cited below. man zsh has a very complete and well
# organized set of man pages.  man zshroadmap has a brief intro.  A user's guide
# to ZSH is available at zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide.
# http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/ has an online version of the man pages.
# zshwiki.org is also a good resource.
# http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/031 explains how test, [, and [[ work
#
# The order of login shells is:
#  * zshenv
#  * zprofile (login shells)
#  * zshrc (interactive shells)
#  * zlogin (login shells)
# Note that /etc/zshenv is read before ~/.zshenv, and the /etc versions of other
# files are similarly read before their dot files.
#
# This file was created by Sam King <sam@samking.org>.  Feel free to
# modify, distribute, and enjoy it.  Also let me know if you discover any other
# cool tricks -- ZSH is too huge for me to know everything about it.
# If I got anything from your zshrc online and forgot to credit you, please let
# me know!

# Shell Prompt
# * PROMPT is PS1, the primary prompt string, which is printed before the
#   command is read.
# * PS2 is printed when the shell needs more info.  Ie, if I type
#   echo $(( 1 + 1 <enter>
#   then the shell needs me to close my parentheses.  By default, it will say
#   which shell constructs or quotation marks need to be closed.
# * PS3 is for select loops.
# * PS4 is for execution trace.
# * See http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html for details
#   on prompt expansion.

# Locale
# * Locale sets what your output should look like for pretty much everything.
#   For instance, do you use commas or dots for numbers?  do you use dollars or
#   euros?  Do you use only ascii or can you use UTF-8?  English or Spanish?
# * The OS probably sets this to the correct value by default, so don't mess
#   with this unless you are getting weird output.
# * If you're using putty, you'll also want to make sure that putty's
#   window->translation is set to UTF-8.
# * LC_ALL sets the locale for everything.
# * LANG sets the locale for anything not set by an LC_something field
# * There are specific LC_ fields if you have a different locale for currency
#   than for time, for instance.  Check out man zshparam for the full list.
# export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8            # use US English encoded in UTF-8 as the

# Processes have resource limits, such as the number of file descriptors or the
# stack size.  running unlimit with no arguments sets the resource limit for
# all resources to the hard limit.  If you use -h, the hard limit is removed.
# if you use -s, the shell limit is removed.
# Check the description of limit in man zshbuiltins for a description of all
# resources that can be limited.
# It can be useful to use limits to prevent a buggy process from opening every
# file on the system or using all available memory with infinite recursion.
# You might want to unlimit everything because it's more annoying to have a
# program crash after running for an hour because it ran out of stack space than
# to run low on memory and manually kill a process.  On the other hand, it is a
# good practice in general not to allow every program to use a ton of stack
# (especially in a multithreaded environment, for instance).

# umask says what permissions files have when they're created (ie, using touch
# or mkdir).  If you use symbolic umask such as
# umask -S u=rw,g=r,o=r
# then you specify what IS allowed.  In this example, the user can read and
# write, and group and other can read.  Noone can execute.
# When you use octal notation such as
# umask 022
# then you specify what is not allowed.  In this case, the group and others
# CANNOT write to newly created files by default.
# If you only want yourself to be able to do anything, you can
# umask 077
# to make it so that noone else has any permissions.
# Either way, your umask will mask against 666, which means that noone will
# have execute permission by default.
